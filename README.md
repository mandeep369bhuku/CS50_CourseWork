## Weekly Problem Sets

* Pset1 : This was the introduction and basic concepts week thus, problems were mostly simple and directed towards building a better understanding of C language. The problems in this problem sets are `hello.c`,`mario.c`, `cash.c` and `credit.c`.
    * `credit.c` : In this problem, Luhn’s Algorithm was implemented. This algorithm was invented by Hans Peter Luhn of IBM. According to Luhn’s algorithm, we can determine if a credit card number is (syntactically) valid or not.

* Pset2 : The problems of week2 were `readability.c`, `caesar.c` and `substitution.c`. In these problems various concepts of C was explored such as Command Line argument (CLA), functions, strings etc.

    * `readability.c` : In this problem, a readability tests was developed, to give a formulaic process for computing the reading level of a text. The Coleman-Liau index (CLI) test was implemented and various text were tested to check reading levels of the text. This program accepts a text, calculates CLI and outputs the grade level needed to understand the text.
    
    * `caesar.c` : Implemented a program that encrypts messages using Caesar’s cipher, key value was given as command line argument by user. The plain text was converted to cipher by the program based on key value.

    * `substitution.c` : This is an improved version of the caesar's cipher. In this case instead of giving a simple value, a 26 alphabets key of characters was given as CLA and plain text was converted to cipher based on the defined key.
